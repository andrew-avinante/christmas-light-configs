# Christmas light configs

This repository is based on the light-controller portion of [midi-lights](https://github.com/andrew-avinante/midi-lights) by [rossmckelvie](https://github.com/rossmckelvie).
For syncing the lights, the [signal](https://github.com/ryohey/signal) repo was forked and modified to be able to sync Christmas lights (WIP and still in a branch)
